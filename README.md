# Description
This project implements functions to create To-Dos. Each To-Do has a title, a description, a due date and a priority that can all be edited at any time by using the icon in the top right corner of the To-Do.

Each To-Do belongs to a Project which has a title and a completion that is computed when a To-Do is set to be done or not done. It is represented as a disc that fills according to the project's completion located at the left of the project's name.
